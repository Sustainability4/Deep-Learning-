1. This folder includes the perceptron introduction and also an introduction to deep learning. The theoretical analysis is provided in the pdf file and the python code for perceptron class implementation is provided in perceptron.ipynb file. This ipynb file also contains the explanation to the idea why perceptron fails for XOR gate. Models are also provided for the AND Gate and are further saved as well for analysis in models folder. All the plots for AND, OR and XOR gate are saved as well in plots folder. 

2. Modular Scripting Directory describes the way in which the above raw code is written and prepared in a proper way as a good developer will do. It will also talk about the basics of logging in python and git basics that we need to understand and remember.
